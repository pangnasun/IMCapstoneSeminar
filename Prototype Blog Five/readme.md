Above is an image of a bas-relief on the wall of Angkor Wat. It shows the Battle of Lanka, which is a part of the ancient Hindu epic called *Ramayana*. The battle takes place at Lanka, the demon king's island, and is fought so Prince Rama can rescue his wife, who is held in captive by the demon king Ravana (depicted in the bas-relief as a being with a thousand hands and a thousand arms). The battle is a clash between two great armies: Rama's army, which is consisted of people and monkeys, and Rava's army, which is consisted of demons. Thus, it respresents the clash between good and evil.

*Ramayana* is an Hindu epic originated in India. In Cambodia, we call the epic *Reamker*, which is based on the *Ramayana* epic but has additional stories. One of those additional stories is the story about the origin of a mountain called Phnom Kraom, which is located in my province. In the Battle of Lanka, Prince Rama's brother Praeh Leak is mortally wounded by a magical arrow. To cure him, the most powerful monkey named Hanuman is instructed to fetch a herb from a mountain. Hanuman does not know the right plant to get, so he returns with the whole moutain with him. Once the right herb is picked, Hanuman starts to fly back to put the moutain back in its original position. However, the great monkey is lazy to fly all the way back, so he throws the mountain from the sky to the ground. The mountain does not land propery because its peak ends on the ground and its base faces the sky. Thus it is come to be known as Phnom Kraom(Phnom means mountain and Kraom means upside-down).

## Phnom Kraom (The Upside-down Moutain)

Growing up, I have heard the origin story of Phnom Kraom told by my parents and elders for a countless number of time. The mountain is so close to our house that we it if no trees are in our line of sight. I guess this is the reason why the story of this mountain comes up quite frequently.
