# Prototype Four: Stories of Angkor Wat (Continued) 

For this week prototype, I was working on my father's favorite myth about Angkor Wat. I still remember hearing this story when I was a kid because it made me fantasize that I could one day become a hero. And I still dream that I could. So, my father told me that deep within the temple, lie a powerful sword and an unbreakable armor. These items only reveal themselves when the right person, (in my head, a hero), comes to seek for them. The person must have a rightous heart heart and a pure soul to be able to yield the sword and wear the armor. Reading what I just wrote made me realize that maybe he's telling me the story to trick me to become a good person, knowing that I probably want to obtain those magical items. However, a part of me belives and will always believe that he truly believes the story because in adajcent to this story and other myths, he would tell me about his real life struggles to survive during and after the Khmer Rouge regime. 

Talking about his life during and after the Khmer Rouge era has never been easy because it is unimaginable what kinds of horror he went through. It was the darkest time in Cambodian history where a mass genocide of 2 million people happened. People were killed, starved and overworked to death. Some died from illness and malnutrition. My father told me how fortunate he was to survive through all of these terrors. When this regime immediately ended, his life was still in peril. Peace had not been established, so fighting between soldiers and militants happpened every day. Thus, when my father traveled to far away places, his life hung on a thread. He told stories of how he could feel bullets fly around him when shootings happened around him and he was only "the width of a hair" from death. He told me stories of his boat capsized in the middle of a thunderstorm, but he managed to survive that. When he was in those dangers, he would find himself chanting mythic runes that he knew to protect him. 

To my father, the myths and stories were and still are an important part of his life. He were able to survive through those dangers because he believes that magical power is left behind by our ancestors to protect us. Like me, I think that he also believes that he could be the person who is worthy of posessing the sword and the armor. 






## Working with Unity
I used existing to create a prototype of what the hidden sword and armor scene could look like. 

<img src="images/entrance1.png">
Players would be traveling in a boat when a mysterious entrance popped in front of them. 
<br/><br/> 
<br/><br/> 

<img src="images/entrance2.png">
Once players entered the entrance, they would be teleported to another place. In front of them stood another entrance. 
<br/><br/> 
<br/><br/> 

<img src="images/entrance3.png">
The doors would only open after players proved their worthiness. The method to determine their worthiness is a work in progress.

Players would then need to travel through the hall way to get to another entrance and enter a secret room.

Inside the secret, the magical sword and shield (armor) would present themselves in front of players.
