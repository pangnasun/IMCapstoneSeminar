## Biography:
Pangna Sun is an Interactive Media and Computer Science major at New York University, Abu Dhabi. His field of interest revolves around Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and immersive Virtual Reality. 

He began his Interactive Media journey during his second year in college. His first Interactive Media course was Introduction to Interactive Media where he used Arduino to create numerous devices like a Morse Box that translated light signals to letters on an OLED screen and a drawing machine that converted users’ codes to physical output on paper. He further continued this path by taking another IM course called Machine Lab. His main product from this class was a small, wooden car that could be remotely controlled by an app on a phone. This car also had an auto-pilot feature that allowed it to navigate on its own by following a designated path. 

During his third year in college, he pursued his passion for robotics by taking an IM coursed called Performing Robots. He built a wooden human robot in which various servo motors were used to create all the joints. These motors were controlled by an Arduino and were programmed to make the human robot move purposely and perform for the audience. 

Currently, he is working on his Interactive Media Capstone project. This project centers on creating a virtual place of a prominent monument called Angkor Wat, which is located in his hometown city. His aim is to virtually bring users back in time to this place through VR and to immerse them in his personal stories about this place, including myths and tales passed down to him by his elders. 

## Artist Statement:

I always dream of giving lives to inanimate objects. Life is the greatest and the most magical of all mother nature’s creations. Thus, the thrill of inserting lives into lifeless objects is beyond measurable. It is impossible to know what it feels like to have the power to give lives to objects since such power seems unattainable. I remember how excited I was when I was able to make a servo motor move and make an LED lightbulb light up for the first time. If experiencing such a small portion of the power to give life brought so much joy, I could only imagine that having the full power would amplify that feeling by at least one thousandfold. 

My quest to initiate lives started with a simple drawing machine. This device was put together by pieces of wood and servo motors connected to an Arduino. When different components of the drawing machine moved autonomously, but in accordance with the program executed by the Arduino, I started to ponder whether I brought this object to life. There was no denial how amazed I was to see this machine perform on its own, but this amazement died down as the device slowly came to a stop at the end of the program. I started to wonder: what does it take for an object to be alive? Is having autonomous motion enough? I came to realize that the answer is no. 

My quest to initiate lives in inanimate objects continued.  I built a humanoid robot from wood with its joints composed of various motors to allow movement. This project was to test whether imitating a person, a living object, would make an inanimate object seem alive. In addition to make the robot look like a person, I also played a recorded speech that aligned with the robot’s actions. For example, the robot would shake its head when the recorded voice said “no.” It turned out that all these elaborated features made the humanoid robot look convincingly alive. However, I still could not let myself believe that I was able to implant a life in these pieces of wood connected together by motors, metals, and glue. The question of being alive and having a soul keeps on bugging me.  

All of these attempts to uncover the creation of lives in inanimate objects resulted in dissatisfaction.  I realized that what I had been doing did not work, so I decided to take a completely different approach to unwrap this problem. I took several steps back and, instead of trying to install lives, I tried to cover the meaning of life and soul first. This is the project that I am currently working on. I am building a virtual reality of a special place where my life is revolving around. I hope being immersed in this place with stories that I am conscious and unconscious of will enlighten me about the essence of life itself. Unlocking this mystery will provide me the key to giving lives to inanimate objects.
