## Biography:
Pangna Sun is an Interactive Media and Computer Science major at New York University, Abu Dhabi. His field of interest revolves around Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and immersive Virtual Reality. 

He began his Interactive Media journey during his second year in college. His first Interactive Media course was Introduction to Interactive Media where he used Arduino to create numerous devices like a Morse Box that translated light signals to letters on an OLED screen and a drawing machine that converted usersâ€™ codes to physical output on paper. He further continued this path by taking another IM course called Machine Lab. His main product from this class was a small, wooden car that could be remotely controlled by an app on a phone. This car also had an auto-pilot feature that allowed it to navigate on its own by following a designated path. 

During his third year in college, he pursued his passion for robotics by taking an IM coursed called Performing Robots. He built a wooden human robot in which various servo motors were used to create all the joints. These motors were controlled by an Arduino and were programmed to make the human robot move purposely and perform for the audience. 

Currently, he is working on his Interactive Media Capstone project. This project centers on creating a virtual place of a prominent monument called Angkor Wat, which is located in his hometown city. His aim is to virtually bring users back in time to this place through VR and to immerse them in his personal stories about this place, including myths and tales passed down to him by his elders.
